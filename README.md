# DeepLearning_CoreML_SwiftUI_BoneFractureDetection
An elegant macOS demo app built with SwiftUI that leverages CoreML for real-time bone fracture detection from X-ray images. This project demonstrates how deep learning models can be seamlessly integrated into Swift-based apps for medical image analysis and AI-powered diagnostics.
